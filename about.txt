I am designing a parental controls app that allows for kids to earn time online by completing assignments. These could be assigned by the admin acount or just a preloaded topic
I am going to create a database of homework sheets to represent major topics.
Main gui
  admin(parents)
    assignable checklist for chores
    kids names amount of time they have availible on countdown timer
    button to add or remove time
    a way to upload study files or worksheets to the app for learning
    an on off switch for each individual kid
  user(kid)
    list of learning topics
    checklist of chores availible
    total time on a countdown timer
    a request time button
    
This project will probably be in development until it is obsolite as I am learning how to complete these things in order to code them.
My origional idea had me cutting off a connection of grouped devices that belong to a single user at the router unless time was available.
Any input or idea or help would be appreciated as I don't know exactly where to begin. I am currently designing a crude dashboard. reach out if you 
feel like you could help or want to be apart of the project.
